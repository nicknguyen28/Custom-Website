                        I am originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, but my family and I moved to Texas before I even turned one.
                        Since then, I have been living in Austin, Texas, up until moving to College Station for school.
                        I am currently a third-year student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree.
                        My interest in computers has been a part of my life since I was a kid.
                        I am fascinated by multiple aspects of computers such as the actual computer parts, software, and video games.

                I love constantly learning about new things and finding different ways to solve problems, which is another reason why I enjoy computer science and know it is the perfect path for me.
                In both school and my free time, I realize that I feel most fulfilled with what I am doing when it requires me to really think and find solutions to any issues or puzzles I may come across.
                My passion for learning and problem solving is fueled by the abundant amount of coding languages and challenging coding exercises available and taught by the university.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I have not completed many personal projects, I plan on completing many of them in the near future in addition to learning several more languages.
                Doing so will allow me to gain experience and pursue my goal as a software programmer.
                I dream of a future as a software programmer because the idea of using code to create amazing things, solve difficult problems, and more to make a huge positive impact on society excites me.
                I look forward to using my expertise in computer science to give back to my community on a large scale.
                I want to help others feel the happiness and excitement I first felt when I experienced the work of software programmers when I was younger, whether they realize the true extent of what led to the final product or not.

                I created this website from scratch using HTML and used CSS to create the two different styles, but since I do not have many coding projects under my belt, I want to learn how to create video games and video game add-ons, like mods.
                In addition to this, I want to complete projects that have an impact on people because doing things that help people makes me feel accomplished and feel like I'm making a difference.

                A coding project that I have completed is a Discord Bot.
                This bot takes in user commands and uses APIs to respond to the command.
                One of these commands is called "lookup," and it uses the Google Search API to conduct a search on a user given query.
                From this, it replies with the top 5 links corresponding with the query.
                Another command that involves APIs is the "r" command.
                This command uses the Reddit API to automatically get a post from the meme subreddit and sends it to the channel, but it can also take an optional input from the user that specifies the subreddit.

                Another project I have completed is an automator for League of Legends.
                This program allows the user to automatically acccept a match with the click of a button.
                The user can also input a champion name to automatically select or ban a champion as well.
                This program uses the PyAutoGUI API to detect images on the screen and
