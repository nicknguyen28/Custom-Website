                        Howdy! I'm a computer science major with a minor in cybersecurity in my final year at Texas A&M University.
                        I was born in St. Paul, MN, but I was raised in Austin, TX. I've had a passion for technology my whole life,
                        and this has driven me to explore its complexities and all the possible things I could do with it.
                        This custom website will be used as a showcase for some of my projects and experiences.

                    In my role as an Artificial Intelligence Trainer at DataAnnotation, I focus on making sure that language models work well.
                    I check their quality and accuracy and find ways to make them better.
                    I also create tests to make sure they work as they should.
                    By doing this, I help ensure that our language models are reliable and effective for different uses.

                <p>
                    As a software developer at Centennial Arts, I was in charge of PowerShell scripts.
                    This included improving scripts, fixing scripts, and even creating new ones.
                    These scripts would be well documented with comments and important information using Confluence.
                    Additionally, I handled the design of websites using WordPress.
                    This required me to use the WordPress interface and add custom HTML and CSS code when necessary.
                    Jira was used to track tickets and the team would have daily meetings to share progress.

                <p>
                    My internship with Accenture was as a business analyst intern.
                    I was responsible for making sure that the existing scripts for SQL, Tableau, and Python
                    were functioning as intended and were up to date and using the correct servers.
                    I also made sure that the inventories for the scripts were up to date as well.
                    Additionally, I used Power Automate to streamline flows for time-consuming activities
                    like assigning tasks and sending approvals. The team I was on held daily meetings to discuss
                    progress, roadblocks, and assign tasks.

                    I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        For my capstone project, my group and I developed an immersive virtual reality social app.
                        In it, users are able to create lobbies and join others to talk, hang out, and share photos.
                        This was created in Unity, with scripts coded in C#. The APIs implemented in this project include
                        the Google Photos API for photo uploading and sharing, the Unity Relay API to allow for multiplayer,
                        and the Vivox API to allow voice chat.

                    <p  class="img-text">
                        A coding project that I have completed is a Discord Bot. This bot takes in user commands and uses APIs to respond to the command.
                        One of these commands is called "lookup," and it uses the Google Search API to conduct a search on a user given query.
                        From this, it replies with the top 5 links corresponding with the query. Another command that involves APIs is the "r" command.
                        This command uses the Reddit API to automatically get a post from the meme subreddit and sends it to the channel,
                        but it can also take an optional input from the user that specifies the subreddit.

                        Another project I have completed is an automator for League of Legends.
                        This program allows the user to automatically acccept a match with the click of a button.
                        The user can also input a champion name to automatically select or ban a champion as well.
                        This program uses the PyAutoGUI API to detect images on the screen and once it finds a match,
                        it will move the mouse over and select the object. If the user wants to select or ban a champion,
                        it will use the API to first type the champion's name in the search box and then to carry out the task.

                        This project is a point of sales system made for the restaurant, Rev's American Grill.
                        It works with a MySQL database in order to keep track of inventory, orders, and menu items.
                        It also included a login feature using OAuth to separate between a customer, server, and manager.
                        The customer interface included accessibility features such as Google Translate, narration, font size adjustment, and an embedded Google Maps block as well.
                        I worked on a team with four other students to create this system utilitizing the Agile methodology and a GitHub repository for collaboration and version control.
